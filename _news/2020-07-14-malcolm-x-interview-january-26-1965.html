<p>In January 1965, Malcolm X visited Dartmouth at the invitation of the Undergraduate Council to give a speech titled “The Black Revolution in America”. His speech, given to a packed Spaulding Auditorium, was not preserved, but the day after his speech, Malcolm gave an extended interview to WDCR. </p>

<p>The historians at Rauner Library graciously digitized the interview tape, and you can now listen to the interview here:</p>

<p>Malcolm X was assassinated roughly 3 weeks from his visit to Dartmouth, making this interview one of his last before his passing. You can read more about Malcolm X's visit to campus <a href="https://exhibits.library.dartmouth.edu/s/HistoricalAccountability/page/malcolm-x-visit">here</a>. </p>

<p>In the 80s, after years of student requests, <a href="https://www.adotson.vsfd.hoodmuseum.dartmouth.edu/home-1">Cutter Hall was renamed</a> "El Hajj Malik El Shabazz Temple", using the name Malcolm adopted after his pilgrimage in Mecca. Most students today know the building as "Shabazz".</p>
