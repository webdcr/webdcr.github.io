<p>Earlier this week, the College announced that they would be selling WFRD (aka 99Rock), Dartmouth Broadcasting’s FM station. WFRD is WebDCR’s sister station, and both have been a part of radio on campus for decades. We are saddened by this news, and will especially miss Chris Garrett, WFRD’s morning show host for over a decade and Dartmouth Broadcasting’s  beloved president. </p>

<p>WebDCR will continue to operate from the 3rd floor of Robinson hall and we look forward to entertaining you for years to come. To all of those who tuned in and to all those who kept WFRD alive over the last half-century, thank you. radio forever💚.</p>
