<p class="">I was able to catch Maggie Rogers for a very special hometown show at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, MD. The venue is a stunning amphitheater with a standing pit, seated areas, and a lawn in the back. The Japanese House, an English indie pop musician, opened for the show, setting the mood with airy and ethereal music. As the sun dipped down, Maggie began the show with the starting track of the album “It Was Coming All Along.” The track paints an image that shows hope for the future.  </p>

<p class="">This was my fourth time seeing Maggie in concert, and I was once again blown away by her vocals. Midway through the show, there was a pause. Governor Wes Moore appeared on stage, declaring June 16th, 2024 as Maggie Rogers Day in the state of Maryland. He thanked her for her work getting concertgoers to register to vote, advocating for reproductive rights, and taking action to ensure fair ticket prices. The last Maggie Rogers show I had been to was in Boston, where the singer appeared in person to sell tickets at the box office for just $25. In addition, she was selling fee-free tickets for her larger arena tour in the fall. </p>

<p class="">Maggie continued to sing while recounting how she had grown up going to the very venue I was watching her play in. The singer wistfully recalled saving up money to see Mumford and Sons, and how she was named godmother to the pianist’s daughter. I felt chills listening to her emotionally charged version of “Overnight,” one of my favorite songs on her first album. This performance, along with the stripped back version of her hit “Alaska,” represented the growth she has experienced as an artist. </p>

<p class="">I am very excited to see Maggie Rogers in the fall and further document her progression as an artist. Maggie’s performances are consistently unique and her talent blows me away every time I am lucky enough to see her live.
