<p>Hanover, NH — WDCR News correspondent Veronica Quidore interviews Prof. Charles Wheelan, a senior lecturer and policy fellow at the Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College. Prof. Wheelan examines the future of bipartisanship in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. In addition to teaching, Prof. Wheelan is the author of several books including “The Centrist Manifesto,” published in 2013, which theorizes a third political party, the Centrist Party, as a means to foster bipartisanship and better policy on both state and national legislative levels.</p>
