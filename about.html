      <h2 class="section-label">Our history</h2>
      <p>
        Dartmouth Broadcasting traces its routes to experiments in
        non-commercial AM broadcasting in the 1920s. In 1941, DBS came on air.
        The station changed its name to WDBS in 1948 and launched a commercial
        AM station in 1958. Its FM station went on air in 1976. During this time
        period WDCR's election coverage was acclaimed. The AM station was shut
        down in 2008 and the FM station was shut down in 2021. Today, WebDCR is
        an online-only station.
