<p>Hello, friends! This is Antônio, speaking to you directly from WebDCR (just kidding, but I miss the station so much I wish it was true). </p>

<p>As we all embark on to week 7, no matter where you are, I bet you have been craving a new playlist to study listening to. It is never easy to discover new music, especially <strong>outside of anglophone North American Spotify bubbles</strong>. But don't you worry! This is what WebDCR is here for! 😉🇺🇳❗</p>

<p>Today, I am pleased to share a custom-made playlist a very dear friend of mine cultivated for us. If you are familiar with the music scene at Dartmouth, you probably know our queen <strong>Sylvie Benson</strong>. But, did you know Sylvie is off to <strong>Japan</strong> this term? 👸🇯🇵</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of sharing the Strauss studio with this amazing human being every weekend for Dance Ensemble rehearsals, and couldn't be happier to accompany her amazing work as a musician herself. For all those reasons, I blindly trust Sylvie to provide me with the best soundtrack the ASCL department has to offer.</p>
