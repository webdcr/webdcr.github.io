<p>Hanover, N.H. — Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang held a town hall at the Hopkins Center for the Arts in Hanover on Sunday. He spoke to a crowd of about 300 Upper Valley residents and Dartmouth College Students about his concerns over increasing automation and his signature Universal Basic Income plan. WDCR News' Daniel Lam spoke to Mr. Yang about his plan to mandate three days of treatment for anyone who suffers a drug overdose, what he expects for Tuesday's primary and what it means to him to be the first Asian American man to run for president as a Democrat. Listen to the full WDCR News Special Report above.</p>
