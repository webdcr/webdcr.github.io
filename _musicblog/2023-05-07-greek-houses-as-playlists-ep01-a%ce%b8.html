<p>Hey you!</p>

<p>New post series just dropped! As a follow up to 'Study abroad as playlists', here is <strong>(Greek) houses as playlists!</strong></p>

<p>If you are affiliated to any of Dartmouth's many Greek Houses or Student Societies, feel free to send me a playlist that you think represents that space!</p>
