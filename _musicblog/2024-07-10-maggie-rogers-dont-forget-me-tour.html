<p>I was able to catch Maggie Rogers for a very special hometown show at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, MD. The venue is a stunning amphitheater with a standing pit, seated areas, and a lawn in the back. The Japanese House, an English indie pop musician, opened for the show, setting the mood with airy and ethereal music. As the sun dipped down, Maggie began the show with the starting track of the album “It Was Coming All Along.” The track paints an image that shows hope for the future.  </p>

<p class="">Maggie continued to sing while recounting how she had grown up going to the very venue I was watching her play in. The singer wistfully recalled saving up money to see Mumford and Sons, and how she was named godmother to the pianist’s daughter. I felt chills listening to her emotionally charged version of “Overnight,” one of my favorite songs on her first album. This performance, along with the stripped back version of her hit “Alaska,” represented the growth she has experienced as an artist. </p>

<p class="">I am very excited to see Maggie Rogers in the fall and further document her progression as an artist. Maggie’s performances are consistently unique and her talent blows me away every time I am lucky enough to see her live. Be sure to check out Maggie’s tour schedule
