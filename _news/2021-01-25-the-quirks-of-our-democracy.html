excerpt: HANOVER, NH — The U.S. government is often said to be “for the people and
  by the people”. Though public elections are a cornerstone of our political system,
  how democratic are they, really? To answer that question for the nation’s presidential
  elections, one has to look at how the electoral process is structured, what its
  outcomes are, and the ways that voters and organizations have navigated it. WDCR
  News's Brandon Dormes investigates.
