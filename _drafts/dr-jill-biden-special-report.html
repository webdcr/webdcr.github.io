<p>Lebanon, N.H. — On Saturday, former Second Lady of the United States Dr. Jill Biden visited Lebanon on behalf of her husband, former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Dr. Biden appeared at the Lebanon field office of her husband's campaign to kick off a canvassing and phone banking event. The visit marks Dr. Biden's fifth visit to the Granite State as a surrogate for the former Vice President. Dr. Biden spoke to seventeen Upper Valley residents about healthcare reform and how a Biden administration would differ from the current Trump administration. WDCR News' Daniel Lam spoke to Dr. Biden about how Vice President Biden is appealing to younger voters, what will be considered "normal" under a Biden presidency and how Dr. Biden would approach the position of First Lady. Listen to the full WDCR News Special Report above.</p>
