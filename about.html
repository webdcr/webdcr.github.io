<h1 class="pagetitle">About WebDCR</h1>
<p>
  WebDCR is Dartmouthâ€™s freeform online radio, produced by and for students!
</p>

<h2>Our history</h2>
<p>
  WebDCR traces its roots to 1924, when members of the college's amateur radio club began broadcasting on the AM band with a federal license.
  The station began broadcasting as WDCR on 1340 AM in 1958 and WFRD on 99.3 FM in 1976. 
</p>
<p>
  Dartmouth College Radio ceased broadcasting as WDCR in 2008, and in 2021, the College <a href="https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2021/07/dartmouth-announces-intention-to-sell-commercial-radio-license-for-wfrd-fm">sold</a> its FM station, WFRD ("99 Rock"). Since then, WebDCR has operated as
  an exclusively online station.
