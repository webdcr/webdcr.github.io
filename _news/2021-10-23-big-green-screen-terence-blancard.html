<p>Yesterday (Tuesday, October 19, 2021 at 8 PM) we (Nicolás Macri and Vania Ding) interviewed Terence Blanchard, a trumpeter and composer of Hollywood film scores and operas, on Film Society’s Big Green Screen radio show.</p>

<p>We had a great discussion about Terence Blanchard’s long career, the power of music and film to advance stories on the human condition, the balance as an artist between discussing trauma and protecting yourself from the inherent difficulties of such taxing work, the experience of minorities like Black Americans in music and film and in society as a whole, and the role of media to advance social progress and understanding.</p>
