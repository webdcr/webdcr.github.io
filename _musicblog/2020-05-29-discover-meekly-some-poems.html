<p class="dropcap-wrapper">America, ignore the window and look at your lap:
even your dinner napkins are on fire.</pre>

<p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/58645/from-summer-somewhere">Danez Smith, from "summer, somewhere"</a></p>

<pre class="wp-block-verse">paradise is a world where everything
is a sanctuary &amp; nothing is a gun. </pre>

<p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/152728/bullet-points">Jericho Brown, "Bullet Points"</a></p>

<pre class="wp-block-verse">...I promise if you hear
Of me dead anywhere near
A cop, then that cop killed me. He took 
Me from us and left my body, which is, 
No matter what we've been taught, 
Greater than the settlement
A city can pay a mother to stop crying,
And more beautiful than the new bullet
Fished from the folds of my brain.</pre>

<p><strong>Nikki Giovanni, "For Saundra</strong>"</p>

<pre class="wp-block-verse">so i thought again 
and it occurred to me 
maybe i shouldn't write 
at all 
but clean my gun 
and check my kerosene supply

perhaps these are not poetic 
times 
at all </pre>

<p><a href="https://poets.org/poem/800-days-libation">Tiana Clark, "800 Days: Libation"</a></p>

<pre class="wp-block-verse"><em>who was there      who was there</em>  &amp; now everyone
is watching your life from inside but I’m afraid to watch
them beat you    watch torture throbbing dry &amp; long
with ache &amp; blue-black bruising                so I don’t
&amp; another black body is blown out      smoking wick</pre>

<p><strong>Ta-Nehisi Coates, from <em>Between the World and Me</em></strong></p>

<p>But all our phrasing—race relations, racial chasm, racial justice, racial profiling, white privilege, even white supremacy—serves to obscure that racism is a visceral experience, that it dislodges brains, blocks airways, rips muscle, extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth. You must never look away from this. You must always remember that the sociology, the history, the economics, the graphs, the charts, the regressions all land, with great violence, upon the body.</p>
