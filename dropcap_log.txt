_musicblog/2020-01-12-history-lesson.html: <p>D</span>artmouth Broadcasting began in the 1920s due to the ambitions of a few Dartmouth College students that decided to try out the new technology called radio. The first broadcast occurred over copper wires linked in all the dorms.</p>

<p>The station used the call letters WDBS (Dartmouth Broadcasting System). The name changed to WDCR (Dartmouth College Radio) when it became an officially licensed station of the Federal Communications Commission and its first official broadcast at 1340 AM was in 1958. Dartmouth Broadcasting began operating our FM rock station, <a href="https://www.wfrd.com/">WFRD 99.3 FM</a>, in 1976.</p>
_musicblog/2023-04-25-oh-inverted-world-by-the-shins.html: <p class="has-text-align-left">I</span> hate the acoustic guitar. Ok, that's not true. I should say I'm less forgiving to acoustic-sounding music, whether that mean one sad man and a guitar, or <em>several</em> sad men, multiple guitars, and light percussion. While I love a lo-fi sound, I can't stand, for example, Fleet Foxes, or (forgive me) Snail Mail. Stop whining! And for the love of God, buy a synthesizer. </p>

<p>This might make my love of the Shin's debut album, <em>Oh, Inverted World</em>, a bit strange. After all, in the liner notes to the 20th anniversary vinyl, Pat McGuire dismisses my kind of music in favor of that emotional instrumental crap I usually hate. About <em>Oh, Inverted World</em>, McGuire writes, "It had melodies! Harmonies! Earnestness! Ardor, zeal! A singer who could really, truly sing! Quirky lyrics you could actually understand, even comprehend!"  </p>

<p>I find this analysis irritating, and not only because it's a not-so-subtle dig at "garage rock revival." I also think <em>Oh, Inverted World </em>has a lot to offer beyond the musical subgenre it represents. It's an incredibly complex album, even if recognizing that complexity takes several listens. On the first listen, you'll notice the beautiful, compact songs, which sonically toe the line between upbeat light rock and a sinister strangeness. But give it a few more, and you'll catch intricate basslines, thoughtful instrumental additions, and unique subtleties. This album does not give everything up at once, even if you can immediately hear all the care that has gone into each song.  </p>

<p><em>Oh, Inverted World</em> feels like a walk through the suburbs on a gray day in an especially inspired mood—wavering between the quotidian, the queasy boredom of small sadness, the nostalgic, and the smarmy told-you-so tone that alternative teenagers love to take with their parents and their friends.  </p>

<p class="">While we are still on the hunt for a new blog editor (yes I'm stepping down, no you won't stop getting posts from me hAH), I wanted to share this little update here. WebDCR is home to an ever-growing and ever-changing community, which makes it an even more special place to share your music, inspirations, and artistic creations. </p>
_musicblog/2020-05-29-discover-meekly-some-poems.html: <pre class="wp-block-verse">To breathe it in, this boulevard perfume
of beauty shops and roti shacks, to take
in all its funk, calypso, reggaeton,
and soul, to watch school kids and elders go
about their days, their living, is, if not 
to fall in love, at least to wonder why
some want us dead.  Again this week, they killed
another child who looked like me.  A child
we’ll march about, who’ll grace our placards, say,
then be forgotten like a trampled pamphlet.  What
I want, I’m not supposed to.  Payback.  Woe
and plenty trouble for the gunman’s clan.
I’m not suppose to.  But I want a brick,
a window.  One good match, to watch it bloom.</pre>

_musicblog/2020-04-10-discover-meekly-lets-get-confessional.html: <p>
  I</span> woke up this morning with several songs stuck in my head, as I often do. I
  don’t know how they get there. I don’t listen to music when I’m going to bed,
  and I remember enough of my dreams to know that they aren’t soundtracked. But
  as I was rinsing my retainers of all the nasty things the human mouth does
  while its host is asleep, the two songs were wrestling each other in and out
  of my brain-folds. I couldn't think about anything else until I wrote a
  multi-part, confessional post for my new music blog. I hate that sentence.
  Quarantine rots the brain.
</p>

<p>
  I listened to the first song,
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68GruRH19Lc"
    >“Heartbeat in the Brain”</a
  >, a lot in high school when I was going through an ugly, prolonged
  heartbreak, where the boy in question was straight and therefore painfully
  inaccessible. The song is pretty “edgy” and does feature some screaming, but
  part of it really resonated with me. I’d often play a 20-second clip over and
  over again while staring at the ceiling, high on angst and hormones.

_musicblog/2024-12-30-joes-top-10-albums-of-2024.html: <p class="">9: Bladee - Cold Visions</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/uploads/premigration/2024/12/bladee-cold-visions.png" alt=""></figure>

<p class="">If there’s anything Bladee does better than most in the underground rap world, it’s aesthetic; outside of how cool one may think the Drain Gang cohort is, it’s undeniable that both Bladee’s musical output and popstar status share a wintery, slightly depressed but hopeful aesthetic. He’s one of the coolest figures in the underground for that reason. <em>Cold Visions</em> capitalizes on this aesthetic in a very consistent and focused manner. The beats are more directly rage-influenced, but Bladee doesn’t compromise on his signature flow and vision, it all feels as composed and intentional as the production on favorites like <em>Icedancer</em>, probably my favorite Bladee project. Bladee delivers some of his more intense and emotional lines on this record, relating a lot of his anxieties as he enters his thirties and becomes distant from friends on songs like “DONT WANNA HANG OUT” and “I DONT LIKE PEOPLE.” On “YUNG SHERMAN” and others you hear more of Bladee’s intense vocal inflections, more lovely melodies that click perfectly with the feelings related in his lyrics. Being an hour long cloud rap endeavor, growing bored of the tedium may happen,  but Bladee finds ways to keep things interesting on this record. This is probably his best, most consistent and listenable release since 2020, again because it all feels so cohesive and aesthetic-driven. I highly recommend this album if you enjoy underground rap in any way, definitely one of the best rage albums I’ve heard in a while.</p>

<p class="">Favorite track: YUNG SHERMAN <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaWsgE2mCik">bladee - YUNG SHERMAN (FT. YUNG SHERMAN) (Official Audio)</a></p>
_musicblog/2022-09-25-from-wdcr-with-love.html: <p><strong>As we reopen the virtual space of WDCR's blog</strong>, I am excited to read, edit, comment, share, and uplift my radio peers' voices. In this long-awaited rebirth, our priority is to make others heard; to create space for stories that, whether already told live or not, belong to our widely diverse and unique community of artists. Radio is all about communicating thoughts one deems worth sharing. It is about making yourself heard, and bringing others along the way. </p>

<p>In our humble, yet insanely crucial written sector, <strong>we hope to highlight experiences and topics that are deeply personal and intrinsic to who we are, and yet create connections over our collective identities.</strong></p>



<p>From WebDCR, with love and hopes of a great blogging future,</p>

_musicblog/2020-09-27-auxiety-quarantunes.html: <p>Why? For starters, this 13-minute epic is one of his best songs. The piece feels like a form of mixed media, with voice-overs, silences, and screams all pasted on top of each other. It also does an excellent job of taking the listener through the multiple cataclysmic mood shifts of the narrator, not unlike the ones I go through when stuck inside. Also, he really hits home on my current routine with, </p>

<p>What should I do? (Eat lunch)</p>

<p>What should I do? (Eat dinner) </p>

<p>What should I do? (Go to bed)</p>

<p>Where can I go? (Go to the store)</p>

<p>Where can I go? (Apply for jobs)</p>

<p><strong>“City Looks Pretty” by Courtney Barnett </strong></p>

<p>Maybe Aussie Barnett is referring to Sydney when she sings, "The city looks pretty when you’ve been indoors for twenty three days, I’ve ignored all your phone calls," but I’m choosing to apply the sentiment to Atlanta, Georgia (where I’ve been quarantining) as well. </p>
_musicblog/2024-07-10-maggie-rogers-dont-forget-me-tour.html: <p class="">I</span> was able to catch Maggie Rogers for a very special hometown show at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, MD. The venue is a stunning amphitheater with a standing pit, seated areas, and a lawn in the back. The Japanese House, an English indie pop musician, opened for the show, setting the mood with airy and ethereal music. As the sun dipped down, Maggie began the show with the starting track of the album “It Was Coming All Along.” The track paints an image that shows hope for the future.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/uploads/premigration/2024/07/845c096e-4875-4abd-8888-ebde4e489991" alt="" style="width:372px;height:auto"></figure>

<p class="">Maggie continued to sing while recounting how she had grown up going to the very venue I was watching her play in. The singer wistfully recalled saving up money to see Mumford and Sons, and how she was named godmother to the pianist’s daughter. I felt chills listening to her emotionally charged version of “Overnight,” one of my favorite songs on her first album. This performance, along with the stripped back version of her hit “Alaska,” represented the growth she has experienced as an artist. </p>

<p class="">I am very excited to see Maggie Rogers in the fall and further document her progression as an artist. Maggie’s performances are consistently unique and her talent blows me away every time I am lucky enough to see her live.

_musicblog/2022-10-22-study-abroad-as-playlists-ep02-japan-lsa.html: <p>H</span>ello, friends! This is Antônio, speaking to you directly from WebDCR (just kidding, but I miss the station so much I wish it was true). </p>

<p>As we all embark on to week 7, no matter where you are, I bet you have been craving a new playlist to study listening to. It is never easy to discover new music, especially <strong>outside of anglophone North American Spotify bubbles</strong>. But don't you worry! This is what WebDCR is here for! 😉🇺🇳❗</p>

<p>Today, I am pleased to share a custom-made playlist a very dear friend of mine cultivated for us. If you are familiar with the music scene at Dartmouth, you probably know our queen <strong>Sylvie Benson</strong>. But, did you know Sylvie is off to <strong>Japan</strong> this term? 👸🇯🇵</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of sharing the Strauss studio with this amazing human being every weekend for Dance Ensemble rehearsals, and couldn't be happier to accompany her amazing work as a musician herself. For all those reasons, I blindly trust Sylvie to provide me with the best soundtrack the ASCL department has to offer.</p>

_musicblog/2020-05-08-discover-meekly-weaving-in-and-out-of-the-hell-zone.html: <p>I</span> don’t want to spend a lot of time meditating or philosophizing on music in the time of corona or any other lukewarm-at-best hot takes, but I did see a tweet that felt very true:</p>

_musicblog/2023-12-30-wrapping-up-2023.html: <p class="">

<p class="">B</span>efore the year comes to an end, I wanted to leave you folks with a little holiday season present. But, you know me, right? I can't just be brief and concise. My brain just doesn't work like that. So, instead -- as evidence of my ever-growing love for our little blog community (me &amp; the voices in my head) -- I bequest you two playlists. Exactly, you heard it right: two. playlists. </p>

<p class="">Not one.</p>

<p class="">Two creations of mine. My blood, my flesh. Firstly, my Christmas playlist: </p>

<figure class="wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify">

_musicblog/2023-02-16-of-montreal-hissing-fauna-are-you-the-destroyer-2007.html: <p>Barnes has always made music that is captivatingly complex. He churns out hooks, and he crams musical ideas and experimentation into every song he writes. Whether you like of Montreal's music or hate it, you'll be hard-pressed to call it boring. And in <em>Hissing Fauna</em>, Barnes makes tunes so danceable it's nearly kitsch, with charming lyricism honed to an emotional height. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

</div>
</figure>

<p><em>Hissing Fauna</em> is about Barnes's divorce, among other things, and the first half of the album sounds appropriately manic-depressive. The first three songs are falsetto, self-aware laments with digital tones, and flow into each other so beautifully that they sound as one. Barnes incorporates staples from his older work—acapella-style background singing, wonderful synth riffs and bass guitar lines that belong on a Top Forty song—into the deceptively-boppy "Heimdalsgate Like A Promethean Curse." "Grolandic Edit," the best stand-alone song of the album, is almost too rhythmically weird to make it onto your indie party playlist, but too catchy to not get queued at some point. A combination of weird, choppy sounds and samples looped onto incredible drum machine tracks gives these songs a playful atmosphere despite their serious subject matter.</p>
