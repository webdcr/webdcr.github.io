<p><strong>by Antônio // September 25, 2022</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>I had to google it to be sure of how it goes exactly, but there is this quote that, at least for me, dictates many of my daily social interactions.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>"Tell me who you<s>r friends are</s> listen to, and I will tell you who you are.</strong>"</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This echoes in my mind whenever I find myself having to get to know people. It happens in family gatherings; on the first week of classes; during a group project, or — as I recently learnt to be another challenge: <strong>at a study abroad program</strong>. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I am currently in Madrid for the Spanish FSP. Supposedly, the whole point of this is wrapping up my minor and getting to know a different culture and different people. But, to my own despair, my boyfriend (who could have taken the program requirements with me early in the year 😫) is on the other side of the world (ok,,, not so far): Buenos Aires! While I am in an FSP, Luka is in the department's LSA+ program. How cool? Really cool! But really far...</p>

<p>Long-distance relationships have their quirks and perks, but that's a story for another post. Music, undoubtedly, is part of our efforts to remain connected. And, today, I use our eight months anniversary (how gay 😫😫) as an excuse to kick off a much-awaited series on the WebDCR blog: </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} --></p>
<h2 class="has-text-align-center">✨✨ Study abroad as playlists! ✨✨</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As part of our blog's hopes of representing and engaging our radio community to its best, we will be kickstarting a miniseries of soundtracks for FSPs, LSAs, and LSA+s our DJs (and adjacent friends) have to share!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>These are not necessarily local songs, as I am gradually learning being abroad as well. In Madrid, we do not listen to only Spanish music; and I don't think anyone would do that! Thus, I hereby present you our first episode/playlist/soundtrack/musical experience off-Hanover limits: <strong>a Buenos Aires</strong> playlist made by my loving and caring significant other, <strong>Luka Faccini</strong>!</p>
