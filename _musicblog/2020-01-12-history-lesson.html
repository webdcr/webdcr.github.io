<p>Dartmouth Broadcasting began in the 1920s due to the ambitions of a few Dartmouth College students that decided to try out the new technology called radio. The first broadcast occurred over copper wires linked in all the dorms.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The station used the call letters WDBS (Dartmouth Broadcasting System). The name changed to WDCR (Dartmouth College Radio) when it became an officially licensed station of the Federal Communications Commission and its first official broadcast at 1340 AM was in 1958. Dartmouth Broadcasting began operating our FM rock station, <a href="https://www.wfrd.com/">WFRD 99.3 FM</a>, in 1976.</p>

<p>To our listeners: thanks for listening us scream into the unending void that is radio for all these years. We couldn't have done it without you.</p>
