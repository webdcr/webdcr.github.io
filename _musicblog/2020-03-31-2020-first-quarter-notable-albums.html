<p>01/10: Alexandra Savior, <em>The Archer</em><br />
</p>01/10: Alexandra Savior, <em>The Archer</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/1the-archer-2-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-279" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">As a sophomore album, Alexandra Savior’s <em>The Archer</em> tightens up her brand as an ethereal, crooning, desert-rock princess. Psychedelic swells and dreamy baselines create a sense of sonic liminality, which Savior describes herself as the feeling of being alone in a bar or stranded in the desert.</p>

<h4>01/17: Mac Miller, <em>Circles</em> (Deluxe version release 03/19)</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-thumbnail is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/2circles-1-150x150.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-282" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">A posthumous album sent directly from heaven—<em>Circles</em> is a beautiful cap to a stellar, gone-too-soon career. Polished but not over-produced, the album feels like Mac Miller’s way of saying “I’m going to be okay and you are too.” Co-writes by Disclosure and baselines by Thundercat in the deluxe version, <em>Circles</em> is a healthy dose of melancholy and a must listen for the year.</p>

<h4>01/31: Frances Quinlan, <em>Likewise</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-thumbnail is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/3-likewise-150x150.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-285" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Philadelphia indie/folk/rock band Hop Along’s vocalist Frances Quinlan takes a dive into the deep end and sets a remarkable example of social distancing with her first solo project, <em>Likewise</em>. With unbounded creative freedom, Quinlan enhances her beloved emotional, witty lyricism with experimental instruments and synthesized sounds.</p>

<h4>02/07: Against All Logic, <em>2017-2019</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-thumbnail is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/4AAL-150x150.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-287" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Against All Logic is an alias for Chilean-American musician Nicolas Jaar. An eagerly anticipated follow-up to the project’s previous, critically acclaimed record, <em>2017-2019 </em>is equally as impressive in composition. The first few songs of the album include seamlessly sampled hooks that Jaar does so well, and flows unhurriedly into a series of syndicated, percussion-heavy beats that clearly reflect his technical skill and deep understanding of electronic music.</p>

<h4>02/14: Tame Impala, <em>The Slow Rush</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-thumbnail is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/5tame-150x150.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-288" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>The Slow Rush</em> is Tame Impala’s fourth album, released five years after <em>Currents</em>—an album that made the project a household name for any modern psychedelic rock fan. Writer, singer, musician, producer Kevin Parker explores the enigma that is time all while putting refreshing, nothing-short-of-genius twists on the sounds and rhythms that are so uniquely Tame Impala.</p>

<h4>02/21: Grimes, <em>Miss Anthropocene</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-thumbnail is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/6grimes-150x150.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-290" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Marking the end of another five-year hiatus between albums, <em>Miss Anthropocene</em> includes some of Grimes’ most sentient, but nevertheless ethereal, works to date. The album sonically reflects the range of her discography—from experimental ambient to speed-fueled benders to vibrant hyper-pop.</p>

<h4>02/21: Kamaiyah, <em>Got It Made</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-thumbnail is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/7-gto-it-made-1-150x150.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-294" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Oakland rapper Kamaiyah gives us <em>Got It Made </em>with Missy Elliot-esk attitude and 90s hip-hop nuances. She commands attention effortlessly—the album is full of high energy bangers that are just waiting to be played at your next pregame, workout, or mid-day dance break.</p>

<h4>02/21: King Krule, <em>Man Alive!</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/8man-alive.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-313" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Genre-bending, emotional, and expertly crafted, <em>Man Alive!</em> reflects an upward trend in the career and maturation of 25-year-old English musician Archy Marshall. Moody and angsty tones nod toward his previous work, but this album is one of his most cohesive yet and demands introspect—sometimes gently, others not—of its listeners.</p>

<h4>02/21: Moses Sumney, <em>græ: Part 1</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/9grae.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-315" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>græ: Part 1</em> is another example of artists rejecting the idea of genre—angelic vocals, chilling monologues, and a variety of sounds. This album comments beautifully on identity and resistance, all while seamlessly weaving jazz-style instrumentation and experimental synthesization.</p>

<h4>02/21: COIN, <em>Dreamland</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/10dreamland.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-316" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Nashville indie band COIN tackles the idea of duality with <em>Dreamland</em>: to live with and without, to perceive and be perceived. With over half the album’s songs out as singles before the official release, COIN continues to surprise their audience with an organized narrative about disillusion, complete with punchy pop hooks and ethereal interludes.</p>

<h4>02/21: Banoffee, <em>Look at Us Now Dad</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/11-banoffee.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-319" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>Look at Us Now Dad </em>is Banoffee’s debut album in the modern pop scene. Club-ready swells, alluring interludes, and vulnerable lyrics combine to create a well-rounded first album.  The only thing left is to wonder: what will she do next?</p>

<h4>02/28: Bad Bunny,<em> YHLQMDLG</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/12-bad-bunny.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-321" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny takes the trap scene by storm with <em>YHLQMDLG, </em>an acronym for “Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana”, or “I do whatever I want.” With deep roots in traditional reggaeton sound, Bad Bunny moves the genre forward with this feel-good, club-ready record that challenges some of the misogynistic and homophobic themes so commonplace to the style. </p>

<h4>02/28: Caribou,<em> Suddenly</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/13suddenly.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-323" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Canadian musician Dan Snaith, also known as Caribou, is not new to the music scene, but <em>Suddenly</em> is surprisingly current and intentional. Blanketed under the electronic genre but more specifically named “folktronica” or “dream pop,” the album begs the listener to decide its identity—or wonder if it even matters.  </p>

<h4>03/06: Megan Thee Stallion, <em>Suga</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/14-suga.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-324" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">The rushed release of <em>Suga </em>is Megan Thee Stallion’s middle finger to her former,  restrictive record label. The release in itself echoes the theme of the album and Megan’s brand as a rapper: I do what I want, when I want. Her iconic phrase “hot girl s***” continues with the album’s high energy beats and (positive) sexually charged lyrics.</p>

<h4>03/06: U.S. Girls, <em>Heavy Light</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/15-heavy-light.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-326" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>Heavy Light </em>is yet another topical and soulful release for U.S. Girls. Don’t be confused by the phrase “yet another”—the record is still as refreshing and unique as one might expect from the pop project. The sounds, lyrics, and spoken word interludes alike pack an emotional and nostalgic punch.</p>

<h4>03/06: Lil Uzi Vert, <em>Eternal Atake </em>(Deluxe version release 03/13)</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/16LUV.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-327" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Lil Uzi Vert’s <em>Eternal Atake</em> defines a new decade of rap. The sonic narrative emulates a journey into space, and the Philadelphia rapper flows with energy and dexterity. The deluxe version, subtitled <em>LUV vs. The World 2 </em>(signaling a sequel to his 2016 album <em>Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World</em>), contains a full EP’s worth of extra songs and a multitude of powerhouse features.</p>

<h4>03/13: Four Tet, <em>Sixteen Oceans</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/17fourtet.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-329" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Seasoned English electronic artist Kieran Hebden surprises and intrigues his audience yet again with <em>Sixteen Oceans</em>. The 16-track album ranges widely and fluidly, some tracks short and melodic, others long and electronic, and many in between.</p>

<h4>03/13: Vundabar, <em>Either Light</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/18either-light.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-330" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>Either Light</em> is a perfect example of indie rock excellence—the three-piece Boston band effortlessly delivers the sounds of a carefree and ephemeral youth. With this record, Vundabar practically invites the listener to roll down the windows and take the long way home.</p>

<h4>03/20: The Weeknd, <em>After Hours </em>(Deluxe version release 03/23)</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/19-after-hours.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-331" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Fourth album by The Weeknd, <em>After Hours</em> is another solid collection of sexy, soulful, R&amp;B ballads. Even though much of his career has been shaped by features and collaborations, the entire EP is just himself and his beats, reflecting a degree of vulnerability that is apparent in his songs.</p>

<h4>03/22: Childish Gambino, <em>3.15.20</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/20CG.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-333" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Musician-entertainer-creative extraordinaire Donald Glover’s latest album <em>3.15.20 </em>rejects the typical aesthetics of an album, with almost entirely numeric song titles and solid-colored cover art. While not exactly a cohesive collection of songs, the record still emanates all the funk and ardor Childish Gambino does so well.</p>

<h4>03/27: Pearl Jam, <em>Gigaton</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/21gigaton.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-334" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Twenty years after tearing through the Seattle alternative rock scene, Pearl Jam’s unbeatable musical energy continues on <em>Gigaton</em>. With guitar riffs sent from the gods and grungy ballads, the album feels current but not without strong nods towards the band’s roots—an incredible feat for a band so far into an incredible career.</p>

<h4>03/27: Waxahatchee, <em>Saint Cloud</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/22-saint-cloud.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-335" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Folksy and pungent as ever, <em>Saint Cloud </em>is arguably Waxahatchee’s magnum opus. Jovial guitar and crystal clear vocals are the name of the game—this album sounds like “a-long-time coming” but also “I’ve-been-here-all-along.“ Her youthful croons make one wonder what they might have missed, even when it is right in front of them.</p>

<h4>03/27: Dua Lipa, <em>Future Nostalgia</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/23-future-nostalgia-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-338" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Her sophomore album, <em>Future Nostalgia </em>is Dua Lipa’s lunge at the pop throne. She has succeeded, with the album being arguably the best, through-and-through pop record of the year so far. High energy disco motifs and powerhouse vocals, <em>Future Nostalgia </em>was made to be belted and danced to, in anywhere from packed clubs (not now though #StayHome) to the living room.</p>

<h4>03/27: Nicolas Jaar,<em> Cenizas</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/24cenizas.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-339" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>Cenizas, </em>which translates from Spanish to “Ashes,” is a fully fleshed out album of the dark, ambient themes Jaar has explored in his previous work. The contrast between this album and his alias Against All Logic’s 02/07 release is stunning, to say the least. Although Jaar is well known for his complex synthesization, <em>Cenizas </em>explores silence, simplicity, and weight, but not without his familiar musical prowess.</p>

<h4>03/27: Little Dragon, <em>New Me, Same Us</em><br />
</h4>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020/03/25-little-dragon.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-340" width="225" height="225"></figure>
</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Swedish alternative electronic group Little Dragon delivers pungent lyrics over groovy tracks on <em>New Me, Same Us</em>. The album gracefully touches on several different genres like electronic, indie, and R&amp;B, but it never fully embodies one—a reflection of their maturation and experience as a band.<br></p>
