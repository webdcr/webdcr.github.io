<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>WDCR News covers newsworthy events around the Dartmouth campus and Hanover as well as statewide issues and current events of interest to the Dartmouth community, in order to inform Dartmouth students, faculty and staff on news and community events.</p>

<h3>Our Ethics</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The values we strive to uphold as a student-run organization include transparency, integrity and accessibility. The working environment we will strive for will be one of collaboration, mutual respect and inclusivity. WDCR News should strive to always maintain the ethos of a locally-minded news outlet that engages topics of national significance in a manner informed by our audience’s interests and needs. In the course of reporting, WDCR reporters should have the courage to pursue stories through a lens different from that used by other Upper Valley media.</p>
