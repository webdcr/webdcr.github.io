<p>Lebanon, N.H. — Former Mayor of South Bend, I.N. and current Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg made two stops in the Upper Valley on Saturday. Mayor Buttigieg held a town hall for over 200 Hanover residents and Dartmouth College students at the Hopkins Center for the Arts in Hanover, which was followed by a rally attended by about 1,000 Upper Valley residents at Lebanon High School. Mayor Buttigieg spoke to both crowds about the importance of Tuesday's first-in-the-nation primary and differentiated himself from his leading competitor for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I.-V.T. He then attacked President Trump and spoke about religion, military experience, and standing up for the middle class. Following the Lebanon rally, WDCR News' Daniel Lam spoke to Mayor Buttigieg about how he handled racial issues in South Bend, his plan to reform the appointment process of justices to the United States Supreme Court and how he would help fight the opioid crisis in New Hampshire. Listen to the full WDCR News Special Report above.</p>
