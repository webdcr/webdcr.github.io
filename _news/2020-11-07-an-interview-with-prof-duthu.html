<p>Hanover, NH — The 2020 Election has far-ranging impacts on Americans from all walks of life. Native Americans and Indigenous communities around the country are no exception. Over the past four years, the Trump Administration ended the annual White House Tribal Conference and opened up swathes of Indian Country to natural resource extraction. WDCR News's Daniel Lam '22 speaks with the Samson Occom Professor of Native American Studies Bruce Duthu about the impact of this election on Native Americans and the political power they wield. Prof. Duthu is a Dartmouth alumnus and former professor at Vermont Law School. </p>
