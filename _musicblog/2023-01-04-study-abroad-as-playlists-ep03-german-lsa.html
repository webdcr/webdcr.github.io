  Welcome back to another year of blogging at your
  favourite campus radio in the Upper Valley! Antônio here, ready to wrap up one
  of the coolest projects I've developed at WebDCR so far: the Study abroad as
  playlists program. To end this properly, I not only highly recommend checking
  what Poly has listened over in Berlin during her summer LSA, but also going
  through the past two posts to get educated on some Argentinian and Japanese
  bops :))
