<h4>by Tom Bosworth // April 10, 2020</h4>

<p>
  I woke up this morning with several songs stuck in my head, as I often do. I
  don’t know how they get there. I don’t listen to music when I’m going to bed,
  and I remember enough of my dreams to know that they aren’t soundtracked. But
  as I was rinsing my retainers of all the nasty things the human mouth does
  while its host is asleep, the two songs were wrestling each other in and out
  of my brain-folds. I couldn't think about anything else until I wrote a
  multi-part, confessional post for my new music blog. I hate that sentence.
  Quarantine rots the brain.
</p>

<p>
  I listened to the first song,
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68GruRH19Lc"
    >“Heartbeat in the Brain”</a
  >, a lot in high school when I was going through an ugly, prolonged
  heartbreak, where the boy in question was straight and therefore painfully
  inaccessible. The song is pretty “edgy” and does feature some screaming, but
  part of it really resonated with me. I’d often play a 20-second clip over and
  over again while staring at the ceiling, high on angst and hormones.
</p>

<p>
  The second verse builds up to this really difficult moment where the speaker
  is trying to hold onto someone that’s already gone:
  <em
    >“I know a few chords that could make you miss me. / They ring and decay in
    this garage every few days. / Just trying to figure out this beat. / So if
    you want to come back east, then maybe you can help me find it.”</em
  >
</p>

<p>
  There’s an essay by poet Jenny Zhang about Tracy Emin’s work that’s part
  confessional essay, part aesthetic statement, and part criticism. She uses a
  couple of instances in her life and her encounters with Emin’s art to defend
  art that’s considered “too sentimental.” There are a couple of paragraphs that
  I think about all the time, but this is one that’s really stuck with me. It
  comes after she observes that we're eager for poetry during extreme times:
  death, loss, grief, suicide, and yes, heartbreak.

  <em
    >“But I want elegies while I’m still alive, I want rhapsodies though I’ve
    never seen Mount Olympus. I want ballads, I want ugly, grating sounds, I
    want repetition, I want white space, I want juxtaposition and metaphor and
    meditation and all caps and erasure and blank verse and sonnets and even
    center-aligned italicized poems that rhyme, and most of all — feelings.”</em

<p>
  Yeah, the song is emotional, emo even. It makes me want to grow bangs that
  cover my eyes. It makes me want to smoke cigarettes behind GameStop. It makes
  me want to crack open an ice-cold Mountain Dew and dew a couple of kickflips.
  But it has a lot to say about letting go. I came back to it after breaking up
  with my partner and found that verse just as potent. It reminded me of a
  <a href="https://www.foundryjournal.com/harvey.html">poem</a> that a friend
  had shared, a short ekphrastic piece with its lines cut so short it reads
  wound up and breathless:
  <em>“I hope / you won’t / need pills / like I / do.”</em>
  The ending is also a sort of “come back east” invitation:
  <em
    >“Please forget / your scarf / in my / life and / come back / later for /
    it.”</em
  >
</p>

<p>
  Rilke writes to the young poet Franz Kappus,
  <em
    >“Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the
    questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are written in a
    very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you
    because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live
    everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without
    noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer.”</em
  >

  I am often so critical of high school Tom, who didn’t have all the tools he
  needed, didn’t have the fancy English classes to be able to explain his angst.
  His poems weren’t good. He didn’t have a confessional music blog. But god, I
  love him for trying anyways. I love him for asking questions with no / bad /
  ugly answers, but also the questions with so much joy, so much possibility in
  their blooming "?".
