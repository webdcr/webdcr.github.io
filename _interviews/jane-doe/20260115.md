      **James:** Thanks for doing this. Set the stage for us—what pulled you into the station?

      **Jane:** I wandered into the studio because the hallway lights were on at 2am. The upperclassmen were debating whether we should digitize our carts, and I wanted to be part of that argument.

      **James:** Describe the vibe in the control room during your first semester.

      **Jane:** Organized chaos. Someone always had a soldering iron out, and someone else was testing a new playlist. You learned to cue vinyl, wrangle phone calls, and hold a conversation all at once.
