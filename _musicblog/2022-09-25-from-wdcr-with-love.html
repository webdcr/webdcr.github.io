<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Not long ago I decided to take part in the <strong>Dartmouth Radio</strong>. The station soon became my second home, and I made friends who would stand by me no matter what. WebDCR became my favourite hobby. It gave me an opportunity no talk non-stop about things that mattered to me. It gave me a fun fact for every Dartmouth introduction — "<em>I'm Antônio, a '25 from Brazil, I use he/they pronouns, and co-host PCSD on WebDCR every Tuesday</em>." It gave me a refuge from my dorm and my day-to-day boring activities and lectures. But, not long after getting involved with it, I realised it had also given me<strong> a community of incredible people with incredible stories to share. </strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>As we reopen the virtual space of WDCR's blog</strong>, I am excited to read, edit, comment, share, and uplift my radio peers' voices. In this long-awaited rebirth, our priority is to make others heard; to create space for stories that, whether already told live or not, belong to our widely diverse and unique community of artists. Radio is all about communicating thoughts one deems worth sharing. It is about making yourself heard, and bringing others along the way. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In our humble, yet insanely crucial written sector, <strong>we hope to highlight experiences and topics that are deeply personal and intrinsic to who we are, and yet create connections over our collective identities.</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here, you will find verticals written by other radio hosts; reports from our News Department; important weekly updates on our schedules, and, overall, a lot of personal insights into who we are. This radio is ours, and taking up, reclaiming, and rebranding this space is a small, gentle step towards the fortification of our communities. </p>
