  Wheelan, a senior lecturer and policy fellow at the Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth
  College. Prof. Wheelan examines the future of bipartisanship in the aftermath of
  the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. In addition to teaching, Prof. Wheelan is
  the author of several books including “The Centrist Manifesto,” published in 2013,
  which theorizes a third political party, the Centrist Party, as a means to foster
