excerpt: Hanover, NH — Dartmouth and the Granite State continue to play an outsized
  role in national politics as seen in this year's first-in-the-nation primary when
  multiple candidates suspended their campaigns following poor performances at the
  polls. Prospective students and freshmen are often reminded that one of the perks
  of attending Dartmouth is the opportunity to experience at least one presidential
  election during their time in Hanover. WDCR News' Daniel Lam '22 speaks with President
  Hanlon to discuss Dartmouth's evolving role in national and local politics and the
  prospect of the college hosting another presidential debate in the coming election
  cycles.
