<p><strong><em>CORRECTION:</em></strong> During the story on David Millman's candidacy, it was stated that all U.S. citizens are eligible to vote in this election. In fact, to be eligible to vote, in addition to being a U.S. citizen, one must also be legally registered to vote in the town of Hanover, NH. A statement was made on air correcting this mistake immediately following the Weekly Update broadcast.</p>
