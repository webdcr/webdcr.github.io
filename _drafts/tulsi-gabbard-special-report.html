<p>Hanover, N.H. — Presidential candidate Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, D-H.I., held a town hall at the Hopkins Center for the Arts on Sunday. Before a crowd of over 200 Upper Valley residents and Dartmouth College students, Congresswoman Gabbard highlighted what has become the central platform of her campaign, her foreign policy and military experience. She spoke about the recent killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, President Trump's military policies and federal spending on the military. During the question and answer period, Congresswoman Gabbard was pressed by an audience member about her interactions with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and defended her relatively high voting absence rate in the House of Representatives. WDCR News' Daniel Lam spoke with Congresswoman Gabbard about her campaign strategy in Iowa and New Hampshire, how her military experience contrasts with that of fellow Democratic presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg and her stance on Medicare for All. Listen to the full WDCR News Special Report above.</p>
