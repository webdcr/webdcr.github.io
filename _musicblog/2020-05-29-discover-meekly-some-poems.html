<p>Was going to write about Chromatica or Bon Iver, or maybe another album, but it all that seems a bit pointless right now. Instead I have some poems. I'll share a little excerpt from each, as well as a link. A lot of these poems were tweeted by @KavehAkbar and @BenPurkert. </p>

<pre class="wp-block-verse">To breathe it in, this boulevard perfume
of beauty shops and roti shacks, to take
in all its funk, calypso, reggaeton,
and soul, to watch school kids and elders go
about their days, their living, is, if not 
to fall in love, at least to wonder why
some want us dead.  Again this week, they killed
another child who looked like me.  A child
we’ll march about, who’ll grace our placards, say,
then be forgotten like a trampled pamphlet.  What
I want, I’m not supposed to.  Payback.  Woe
and plenty trouble for the gunman’s clan.
I’m not suppose to.  But I want a brick,
a window.  One good match, to watch it bloom.</pre>

the Orioles. Old Bay on all my shrimp.
And justice. And cities burning
if people need to burn them to get free.

<pre class="wp-block-verse">...I promise if you hear
Of me dead anywhere near
A cop, then that cop killed me. He took 
Me from us and left my body, which is, 
No matter what we've been taught, 
Greater than the settlement
A city can pay a mother to stop crying,
And more beautiful than the new bullet
Fished from the folds of my brain.</pre>

<pre class="wp-block-verse">so i thought again 
and it occurred to me 
maybe i shouldn't write 
at all 
but clean my gun 
and check my kerosene supply


perhaps these are not poetic 
times

<p>But all our phrasing—race relations, racial chasm, racial justice, racial profiling, white privilege, even white supremacy—serves to obscure that racism is a visceral experience, that it dislodges brains, blocks airways, rips muscle, extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth. You must never look away from this. You must always remember that the sociology, the history, the economics, the graphs, the charts, the regressions all land, with great violence, upon the body.</p>
