<p>Hanover, N.H. — Former New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, held a "Young Dems Meet-and-Greet" at the Salt Hill Pub with members of the Dartmouth College Democrats on Thursday. Since Monday, Gov. Lynch has been on a state-wide "Live Free, Vote Joe" tour to speak with New Hampshire voters as a surrogate for the Joe Biden campaign. In Hanover, Gov. Lynch spent most of his time speaking to the Dartmouth Democrats about a more local issue, N.H. H.B.1264, a new residency law that has tied voter registration to residency in the state, a law that many argue makes it more difficult for college students in the state, including students here at Dartmouth, to vote. Gov. Lynch expressed support for college students, telling the audience that if they live in New Hampshire, they should vote in New Hampshire. WDCR News' Daniel Lam spoke to Gov. Lynch about his support for Joe Biden, the reception he has received on his "Live Free, Vote Joe" tour and how he interprets recent polls showing the former Vice President trailing in the polls. Listen to the full WDCR News Special Report above.</p>
