  <strong
    >As we reopen the virtual space of WDCR's
    blog</strong
  >, I am excited to read, edit, comment, share, and uplift my radio peers'
  voices. In this long-awaited rebirth, our priority is to make others heard; to
  create space for stories that, whether already told live or not, belong to our
  widely diverse and unique community of artists. Radio is all about
  communicating thoughts one deems worth sharing. It is about making yourself
  heard, and bringing others along the way.

  In our humble, yet insanely crucial written sector,
  <strong
    >we hope to highlight experiences and topics that are deeply personal and
    intrinsic to who we are, and yet create connections over our collective
    identities.</strong

</p>

<p>From WebDCR, with love and hopes of a great blogging future,</p>
