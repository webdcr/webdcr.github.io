<p>Yes, I love this one. I know it's 3AM and we're in your East Wheelock eight-room triple, but I'm about to play something I really think you're going to like. Just like, close your eyes and try and follow the lyrics ok? I know this one is a little out there but please just give it a chance.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Ricky can you turn the lava lamp on? Word. This song is going to knock your socks off I promise. *I pass you my Dab Pen.* Just try and relax. Just wait for the beat switch and you're in for a treat. I promise you that you haven't heard anything like this before. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yes, Boloco is on its way. Can we just have 2 minutes of quiet? Frank is about to really lay it down. Really, he's dealing with a lot of stuff that I, a white, straight man, can relate to and explain. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ok, ok maybe that didn't hit you like it hit me, but this next one is really going to do it. I don't care if you're about to throw up. I really need you to experience this with me. </p>

<p><br>*I'm lying on my back on the couch of your East Wheelock 8-room triple and waving my hands like I'm orchestrating <em>Alt</em>-<em>J's </em>hit song "Breezeblocks."* Does anyone have cash to tip the Boloco dude? No?</p>

<p>Wait wait this is my favorite part. Is the lava lamp on? </p>
