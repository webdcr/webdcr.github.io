<p class="">After going viral for the hit song “Ceilings,” Lizzy McAlpine returned with her third album <em>Older</em>. <em>Older</em> channels the soulful, folk-inspired vulnerability and storytelling that is at the heart of why Lizzy has made strides in the music world. </p>

<p class="">I recently had the opportunity to see Lizzy at The Anthem, a venue in Washington D.C. with a capacity of 6,000, where she played two back-to-back sold-out shows. Lizzy began with “The Elevator,” the opening track on <em>Older</em>, which grounds the rest of the album’s story of a relationship gone awry. The setlist continued with most of the album in chronological order, with older tracks such as “Doomsday” and “Chemtrails” from her sophomore album <em>five seconds flat </em>weaved in. </p>

<p class="">Lizzy’s performance of “Doomsday” especially showcased her growth since I last saw her in 2022, during the <em>five seconds flat</em> tour. Her vocals have somehow improved and her comfort on stage is evidenced by her performance. She added tons of rifts and interesting note changes that were received very well by the audience, who were energetic yet respectful. Her live performance of the title track “Older” was extremely soulful and further conveyed the vulnerability of the album. In addition, I was excited to hear the bridge of “Vortex,” a song that releases the frustration and chaos present within the relationship. The metaphor of a vortex runs throughout many songs, anchoring the album and setlist as a whole. </p>

<p class="">The stage design cultivated a home-like atmosphere, with it being set up to mirror a living room. Ambient lamps, wooden furniture, and an acoustic piano contributed to the comfortable atmosphere that allowed Lizzy’s artistry to shine. The lack of an opener also allowed the show to start at around 8:45 and end at around 10, which I certainly appreciated. Her performance ended with rapturous applause as well as an encore, where she sang fan-favorites such as “Apple Pie” and “Ceilings.” </p>

<p class="">I felt the benefits of her improved tour setup, namely her increased confidence and joy on stage. After rescheduling part of her UK/EU tour in May of 2023 to prioritize her mental health, it is evident that the new setup is working for her. Lizzy is headed to the East Coast, playing at Radio City in New York on June 18 and 19, as well as MGM Music Hall at Fenway in Boston on June 21 and 22. Be sure to catch her in your area. I am incredibly excited to see how she continues to grow as an artist and look forward to what’s next! </p>
